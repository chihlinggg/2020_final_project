It is just 3 - 4 minutes from Taipei 101 and also from the MRT station. Also, the airport shuttle bus stops right in front of the hotel. The hotel true to the hotel rating is huge, with 5 star facilities. The Gym and the spa are great but did not much like to swimming pool which was average to say the least. While everything about the hotel is great but we just felt that it was a bit cold and contrary to everyone in Taipei being so warm, the staff were professional but not warm and friendly. As I stay in many places around the world, I could compare and more so I felt everyone in Taipei is extra warm and friendly but in Grand Hyatt Taipei, the staff may need some orientation on this aspect.

They made us wait for an hour. If I did not notify the hotel that I was with my 85-year-old mother, they would have just let us wait at the lobby for one more hour. Two hours of waiting is too much, and that means two hours taken off from one day of our stay, considering that the rooms are priced above average. I also had a hard time booking a table for two at their buffet restaurant (Cafe). However, when I told the Reservations Officer that we were able to book a table in buffet restaurant another 5-Star hotel, they suddenly found a table for us. And that was weird. If not for the close up window view of the Taipei 101, I would not recommend this hotel to my relatives and friends at all. Well, at least this hotel has something to boast of, and that is the view of the Taipei 101. ", "time": {"comment": "2018/05/08"}, "labels": {}},

It is located right next  to the iconic 101 Tower and just 5 minutes from the subway. I have always been impressed with Hyatt chain and have stayed with them for many years previously. The high quality of their service and amenities have been consistent all these years. Their beds, bed linen and bath towels are superbly comfortable and plush. \r\nThe Grand Hyatt Taipei is one of their best examples. The design and quality of the hotel building are outstanding. I like in particular their color scheme which is a pleasing combination of beige and brown. This seems to be the Hyatt theme. Very soothing after a long flight or day. \r\nThe service was outstanding. We were checked in (by Shelley) in less than 3 minutes. That's fantastic service. She was  very professional and friendly. \r\nThe bell service sent up our bags very fast as well. \r\nThe room has full amenities. I would like to mention that info addition to the usual , the room had rain shower and an Elly coffee machine. Very well appointed. \r\nThere is a number of good restaurants in the hotel. The irodori Japanese restaurant is recommended. \r\nWe had a wonderful stay. Will be back", "time": {"comment": "2018/02/23"}, "labels": {}},
